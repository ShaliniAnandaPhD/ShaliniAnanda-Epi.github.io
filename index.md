## Epigenetic drug discovery 

Please feel free to use this repo to view and run tools created for epigenetic drug discovery. Here is a quick introduction to epigenetic drug discovery. 

What is being created here: 
In the next set of blogs, we will delve into tools created via machine learning and quantum computing to be used specifically to determine if certain drugs can be repurposed for a different condition than initially intended. 

What is epigenetics?
Epigenetic events such as air pollution and living with extreme malnutrition act as a mediator to trigger genetic mechanisms to affect gene expression. Epigenetics has been implicated in several diseases including lung fibrosis and Rett's syndrome. Epigenetics study the causal interaction between genes and their products that affect phenotype. It is uderstood that the environmental landscape affects the developmental landscape and this in turn affects acquired characteristics [1]. Through several studies, we learn that epigenetic information is pertinent for the regulation of gene expression and differentiation and are often heritable without altering much of the DNA sequence. 

How does epigenetics happen? 
The expression and activity of proteins and genes can be modulated via mutuations,modulation via small and large molecules that are naturally occuring substrated and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as acetylation and methylation of histones and DNA. Genes are expressed when chemical tags attach to DNA and histones. This regulates the euchromatin state needed for active transcription. Epigenetic modification encompasses 3 types of epigenetic markers (namesly, writers, readers and erases) acting on three major substrates such as DNA, histones and noncoding RNAs. The components of the epigenetic machinery is highly connected and influenced by factors such as nutrition, environmental factors, stress factors and other chemical factors. DNA methylation directly affects the genemic DNA and is accomplished by DNA methyltransferases - here methyl donor groups from the S-adenosylmethionine to the 5' position of the cytosine ring within the 5'-cytosine=phosphateguanosine-3' (CpG) sites. DNA methylation plays an important role in genomic imprinting, suppression of retrotransposons, maintenance of genome stability, X-chromosome activation. 

Who becomes susceptible to epigenetic diseases?
Some argue that epigenetic memory is passed from generation to generation[2]. This means memory can be transfered across generations without the need of reexposure to the same epigenetic factors. Some researchers find that effect of altered epigenetic markers in early life stages is not only as adaptive responses or coping mechanisms and also manifest as adult onset diseases such as hormonal changes [3]. 

The objective of this series is to study causal relationships between genetic markers, changes in these genetic markers and link this to external factors.
